# Bad-word-censor-using-python-speechrecognition-api

I wrote this short piece of code to explain the important and basic bits of speech recognition api of python.<br><br>
To install this api:<br>
1.pip install speechrecognition<br>
2.pip install pyaudio<br>

All this code does is takes a sentence (voice) as input and converts it into text and censors the inappropriate or "bad words".
I realised when doing this that the speech api censors some english bad words itself so i added a bunch of hindi words into the text files as the api does not censor these. You can more add words of your language into the text file and try it because its current vocabulary is small<br>
